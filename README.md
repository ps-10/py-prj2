This repo contains standalone Python files. These files have python code that I typically use for doing data analysis at my work.
I cannot use the company confidential code or data or anything for demonstration in this public repo.
So I use "sample data" or "mock-up" the data just enough to allow python functions to operate on them.
The intent is to share this for learning purposes (esp. using my comments) for anyone who may need it.
